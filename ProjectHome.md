Appleseed Portal is an initiative to produce a free enterprise CMS and Portal engine.  The source code wast started from IBUYSPY/Rainbow Portal (2003) and builds on their tradition of simple install, design, and extension.

Our project runs with a for profit vision but produces a free product.  Tasks are assigned to our developers which they can either do for free or get paid for their services.  The result is a well produced ( and QA'ed ) piece of software by software professionals given for free to All.

Our project uses ASP.NET 4.0 | IIS7 | SQL Server 2005 / 2008

We hope to produce a mono version that runs on different database platforms as well ( such as mysql).
